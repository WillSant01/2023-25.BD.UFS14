Abstract
The Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredien t Safety (Panel) assessed the safety o f 10 alkane diol ingredients as used in
cosmetics. The alkane diols are structurally related to ea ch other as small diols, and most are reported to function in
cosmetics as solvents. The Panel reviewed the relevant data f or these ingredients, and concluded that seven alkane diols
are safe in cosmetics in the present practices of use and concentration described in this safety assessment, but that the
available data are insuf ﬁcient to make a determination of safety for three i ngredients, namely 1,4-Butanediol, 2,3-Bu-
tanediol, and Octanediol.

Introduction
This assessment is a review of the safety of the 10 alkane diolslisted below (with systematic nomenclature in parenthesiswhen different from the ingredient name) as used in cosmeticformulations:
Propanediol
(1,3-
propanediol)Octanediol (1,8-octanediol)
1,4-Butanediol 1,10-Decanediol
2,3-Butanediol Methylpropanediol (2-methyl-1,3-propanediol)
1,5-Pentanediol Butyl Ethyl Propanediol (2-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-
propanediol)
Hexanediol
(1,6-
hexanediol)Isopentyldiol (3-methyl-1,3-butanediol)
The alkane diols reviewed in this safety assessment have
various reported functions in cosmetics ( Table 1 ), as in-
dicated in the web-based International Cosmetic Ingredient
Dictionary and Handbook (wINCI; Dictionary ). Most of
the alkane diols are reporte d to function in cosmetics as
solvents, but other reported functions include humectants,skin conditioning agents, plas ticizers, fragrance ingredi-
ents, and viscosity decreasing agents.
1,2Propanediol, for
example, is used as a solvent and viscosity decreasingagent; Butyl Ethyl Propan ediol is used as a skin-
conditioning agent and humectant.
The alkane diol ingredients in this report are structurally
related to each other as small diols. Diols with 1,2-substitutionregiochemistry (e.g., 1,2-Butanediol) have been reviewed
previously by the Panel, and the conclusion for each is
summarized in Table 2 .
3-11Almost all of these previously-
reviewed diols were assessed to be safe as used; PropyleneGlycol (aka 1,2-propanediol) was deemed to be safe as usedwhen formulated to be non-irritating. Please see the originalreports for further details ( https://www.cir-safety.org/

Chemistry
Deﬁnition and Structure
All of the ingredients in this report are structurally related to
each other as small diols (i.e., three to ten carbon alkyl diols).
The ingredients in this report include regiochemistry other
than 1,2-substitution. For example, 2,3-Butanediol is a vicinaldiol with the ﬁrst hydroxyl substitution at the 2-position and1,4-Butanediol is a terminal diol with substitution at the 1- and
4-positions ( Figure 1 ).
Variations in the regiochemistry of small alkane diols may
lead to signi ﬁcant differences in toxicity. For example, 2,5-
hexanediol, which is not a cosmetic ingredient, is known to bea neurotoxic metabolite of hexane.
38,39However, the struc-
turally similar cosmetic ingredient, Hexanediol (i.e., 1,6-
hexanediol), is not a neurotoxin.
Physical and Chemical Properties
Alkane diols can be liquids or crystalline solids. Some are
soluble in alcohol ( Table 3 ). All of the terminal diols are
soluble or somewhat soluble in water, except for thelongest chain ingredient, 1,10-Decanediol, which is
nearly insoluble in water. The branched alkane diols
among these ingredients are very soluble in water, withthe exception that Butyl Ethyl Propanediol (C9) is onlyslightly soluble.
Method of Manufacture
Propanediol. Propanediol may be prepared by fermentation
from corn-derived glucose using a biocatalyst (non-
pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli K-12).40Propanediol
can also be manufactured by heating γ,γ-dihydroxydipropyl
ether with hydrobromic acid, followed by hydrolysis withsodium hydroxide. It is also reported to be obtained fromplants that produce glycerol.
37
1,4-Butanediol. Some industrial chemical companies manu-
facture 1,4-Butanediol using cupric acetylide catalysts in the
condensation reaction of acetylene with formaldehyde.37
Some manufacturers convert propylene oxide to allylTable 2. Aliphatic Diols and Constituent Acids Previously Reviewed by the Panel.

hydroxybutyraldehyde, followed by reduction to the diolvia hydrogenation.
21Maleic acid and succinic acid can be
used to manufacture 1,4-Butanediol via vapor phase hydro-genation of their corresponding esters and anhydrides. E.coli
can be genetically engineered to metabolize sugar to 1,4-
Butanediol.
41
2,3-Butanediol. 2,3-Butanediol has been commercially pro-
duced by fermentation of molasses or sugar using Mesen-
tericus ,Aerobacter ,Klebsiella , and Serratia bacteria; Bacillus
polymyxa ,Lactobacilli and Staphylococci strains and ﬁla-
mentous fungi (e.g., Rhizopus nigricans ,Penicillium ex-
pansum ) can also produce 2,3-Butanediol.37Fermentation of
potatoes or wheat mash also yields 2,3-Butanediol. Mixtures
of gases containing isobutylene and n-butenes, when com-
bined with hydrogen peroxide and formic acid, yield a productcontaining 2,3-Butanediol, fractions of which are collected bydistillation. The meso -form of 2,3-Butanediol can be prepared
from trans -2,3-epoxybutane; the
D-form can be prepared by
fermenting carbohydrate solutions with Bacillus subtilis .42
1,5-Pentanediol. 1,5-Pentanediol can be prepared in the
presence of copper chromite via hydrogenolysis of tetrahy-drofurfuryl alcohol.
42
1,10-Decanediol. 1,10-Decanediol may be prepared by re-
ducing diethyl or dimethyl sebacate with sodium metal inethyl alcohol. It may also be prepared by catalytic hydroge-nation of sebacic esters.
42
Methylpropanediol. On an industrial scale, carbon monoxide
and hydrogen can be used to hydroformylate allyl alcohol tothe intermediate, hydroxymethylpropionaldehyde, which isthen hydrogenated to yield Methylpropanediol.

Impurities
Propanediol. The following Food Chemicals Codex accep-
tance criteria apply for Propanediol in relation to foodpreparation: cobalt ( ≤1.0 mg/kg or 1 ppm); lead ( ≤1.0 mg/kgor 1 ppm); nickel ( ≤1.0 mg/kg or 1 ppm).
2,40The purity of
Propanediol should be ≥99.9% and water content should
be≤.1%. A manufacturer reported Propanediol to be 99.8%
pure (impurities were not provided) and stated that the productdid not contain added preservatives, animal by-products, orpetroleum ingredients.
43Propanediol was reported to
be≥99.98% pure; water was listed as an impurity, but no
heavy metals, monomers, or amines were known to bepresent.
44
1,4-Butanediol. Maleic acid and succinic acid may be potential
residual impurities of 1,4-Butanediol because they aresometimes used as starting materials in the manufacture of thisingredient, as mentioned above.
211,4-Butanediol has been
reported to be 98% pure.22
1,5-Pentanediol. 1,5-Pentanediol was found to be 98.1% pure
by gas chromatographic/mass-spectrometry analysis; a total of.28% unknown impurities (not diols, as stated by the studyauthors) were reported.
45Contamination by water, 1,5-hex-
anediol, and 1,6-Hexanediol was found to be .02, 1.02, and.56%, respectively. Other diol impurities, including 1,4-Bu-
tanediol, 2,5-Hexanediol, and cyclic diols, were below the
limit of detection (<.05%).
Hexanediol. Hexanediol has been reported to be >96% pure
(impurities were not speci ﬁed).
46
Methylpropanediol. Methylpropanediol has been reported
to be 98% pure (maximum 2% impurities; maximum .1%
water content, maximum .05% carbonyl content) by a
manufacturer.47
Isopentyldiol. Isopentyldiol has been reported to be 97% pure
with 3% of impurities (no further details provided).19Isopentyldiol
is >99% pure as reported by a cosmetics raw material supplier.48

Use
Cosmetic
The Panel evaluated the safety of the cosmetic ingredients
included in this assessment based on the expected use of and
potential exposure to the ingredients in cosmetics. The data
received from the US FDA are collected from manufacturersthrough the FDA Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program(VCRP), and include the use of individual ingredients incosmetics by cosmetic product category. The data receivedfrom the cosmetic industry are collected by the Personal CareProducts Council (Council) in response to a survey of themaximum reported use concentrations by product category.
VCRP data obtained from the FDA in 2018
50indicated that
eight of the alkane diols are being used in cosmetic formu-lations ( Table 4 ). Propanediol has the highest number of re-
ported uses (1528 uses), followed by Methylpropanediol (570uses). Results from a concentration of use survey conducted in2015
51(Table 4 ) indicated that the ingredients with the highest
maximum reported concentrations of use were Propanediol(39.9% in non-spray deodorants), Methylpropanediol (21.2%
in body and hand products), and Isopentyldiol (15% in non-
coloring hair formulations).
In some cases, uses of alkane diols were reported in the
VCRP, but concentration of use data were not provided in theCouncil survey. For example, 1,4-Butanediol is reported to beused in 5 cosmetic formulations, but no use concentration datawere reported.
50Conversely, there was an instance in which
no uses were reported in the VCRP, but use concentrations
were provided in the industry survey; Butyl Ethyl Propanediol
was not reported to be in use in the VCRP, but the Councilsurvey indicated that it is used at concentrations of .29% intonics, dressings and other hair grooming aids.
51It should be
presumed that there is at least one use in this category.
There are no frequency or concentration of use data re-
ported for 2,3-Butanediol or 1,5-Pentanediol.50,51
Alkane diols were reported to be used in cosmetic sprays,
including perfumes, hair sprays, and deodorants, and could
potentially be incidentally inhaled. For example, Propanediolwas reportedly used in aerosol and pump hair sprays atconcentrations up to .12 and 1.5%, respectively, and it wasused in face and neck sprays at concentrations up to 3%.
51
Isopentyldiol was reportedly used in perfumes and aerosoldeodorants at concentrations up to 5% and up to 1%, re-spectively. In practice, 95% to 99% of the droplets/particles
released from cosmetic sprays have aerodynamic equivalent
diameters >10 µm, with propellant sprays yielding a greaterfraction of droplets/particles below 10 µm compared withpump sprays.
52-55Therefore, most droplets/particles inci-
dentally inhaled from cosmetic sprays would be deposited inthe nasopharyngeal and bronchial regions and would not be
respirable (i.e., they would not enter the lungs) to any ap-preciable amount.
52,54There is some evidence indicating that
deodorant spray products can release substantially largerfractions of particulates having aerodynamic equivalent di-ameters in the range considered to be respirable.
54However,
the information is not suf ﬁcient to determine whether sig-
niﬁcantly greater lung exposures result from the use of de-
odorant sprays, compared to other cosmetic sprays.Isopentyldiol was reportedly used in face powders at con-centrations up to .33%,
51and could possibly be inhaled.
Conservative estimates of inhalation exposures to respirableparticles during the use of loose powder cosmetic products are400-fold to 1000-fold less than protective regulatory and
guidance limits for inert airborne respirable particles in the
workplace.
56-58
Some alkane diols were reported to be used in cosmetic
formulations indicative of potential eye exposure (e.g., Pro-panediol is used at up to 10% in eye makeup removers) andpossible mucous membrane exposure and ingestion (e.g.,Propanediol at up to 10% in dentifrices). Propanediol wasreported to be used in baby shampoos and baby lotions, oils,
powders, and creams (concentrations of use were not
reported).
None of the alkane diols named in this report are restricted
from use in any way under the rules governing cosmeticproducts in the European Union.
59In a NICNAS report,
Isopentyldiol was determined not to be an unacceptable risk topublic health in cosmetic products up to 10% (the highest useconcentration reported in the NICNAS document).
19
Non-Cosmetic
The non-cosmetic uses of 1,4-Butanediol, Hexanediol, andMethylpropanediol, as speci ﬁed in the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) Title 21, are described in Table 5 . 1,4-
Butanediol and Hexanediol are permitted as indirect foodadditives.
1,4-Butanediol. 1,4-Butanediol is known to be an illicit drug of
abuse because of its conversion to gamma-hydroxybutyricacid (GHB) after oral administration.
60GHB, occurring en-
dogenously in mammals, is a neurotransmitter with a highafﬁnity for pre- and postsynaptic neuron GHB-receptors.
60,61
In 1999, the FDA issued a warning about products (i.e., di-
etary supplements advertised as a sleep aid) containing 1,4-
Butanediol and gamma-butyrolactone because of reports
linking these compounds to adverse health effects (eg, de-creased respiration) and 3 deaths. In this warning, the FDAnoted 1,4-Butanediol to be a Class I Health Hazard (poten-tially life-threatening risk). GHB has been used in dietarysupplements because it can reportedly increase physiologicalconcentrations of growth hormone, leading to an increase inlean muscle mass; weight control and sedation were other
effects of GHB ingestion advertised by health food stores.

Propanediol (40CFR180.910 and 40CFR180.930) when
“…used as an inert ingredient in pesticide formulations
applied to growing crops, raw agricultural commodities after
harvest, and to animals (used for food). ”78S International Journal of Toxicology 43(Supplement 2)In 1997, the FDA re-issued a warning for GHB used rec-
reationally and in body building because it caused seriousadverse health effects.
28As of 2000, the Drug Enforcement
Agency (DEA) reported GHB to be a Schedule I ControlledSubstance and 1,4-Butanediol and gamma-butyrolactone to becontrolled substance analogs if they are intended for human
consumption pursuant to 21 USC §§802(32)(A) and 813.

1,5-Pentanediol. 1,5-Pentanediol has been reported to have
antimicrobial and antifungal properties in pharmaceutical
applications.
45,62-64Additionally, 1,5-Pentanediol has re-
ported uses in products for hair loss, cold sores, nail problems,dry and scaly feet, and eczema; it can be used as a moisturizingsubstance and solvent.
64According to information submitted
to CIR, 1-5 Pentanediol is used at concentrations of 5 - 25% inproducts used for baldness, dandruff, cold sores, nail fungusinfections, and for the treatment of foot problems.

Toxicokinetic Studies
Dermal Penetration
In vitro
Propanediol. A dermal penetration study conducted using
human cadaver skin evaluated the penetration of Propane-diol.
12The stratum corneum (abdominal region of human
cadaver skin, n = 6 representing 3 donors) was mounted on an
in vitro static diffusion cell (skin surface area .64 cm2). The
experiment was conducted using Good Laboratory Practice(GLP) and in accordance with OECD Test Guideline (TG) 428(Skin Absorption: in vitro Method). A solution containing1.059 g/mL Propanediol (purity 99.953%) was applied to theskin (1200 µL/cm
2,i nﬁnite dose) in the donor chamber
(opening to chamber was occluded). The receptor ﬂuid (.9%
saline) was maintained at 32°C in a recirculating water bath
and was sampled at time zero and every 4 - 6 hours up to48 hours post-application. The permeability coef ﬁcient was
calculated to be 1.50 × 10
/C05cm/h, based on the slope at steady
state (15.9 µg/cm2/h) and the concentration of Propanediol
applied (test solution density 1,059,700 µg/cm3). The per-
centage of the applied Propanediol recovered from the re-ceptor chamber 48 hours post-application was .12%.Penetration Enhancement
In vitro. Provided below is a summary of penetration exper-
iments that are presented in greater detail in Table 6 .

Pentanediol to enhance the penetration of the drug estradioli nh u m a ns k i nw a se v a l u a t e di na ni nv i t r oe x p e r i m e n tusing a Franz diffusion cell; (.05 M isotonic phosphatebuffer, pH 7.4 with .01% mercury chloride was used as thereceptor ﬂuid).
66The test substance (100 µL of .12% [3H]-
estradiol in 1:10 Propanediol, 1,4-Butanediol, or 1,5-Pentanediol/ethanol soluti on) was applied to the dermis,
which faced the receptor side of the cell. Receptor ﬂuid
samples were collected at various time points. The steady-state ﬂux of estradiol in Propanediol, 1,4-Butanediol, and
1,5-Pentanediol was determined to be .11, .017, and.005 µg/cm
2/h, respectively, indicating a decrease in
steady-state ﬂux with increasing alkyl chain length. After ∼
85 - 90 minutes the permeability of [3H]-estradiol in human
skin was ∼5-6µ g / c m2with Propanediol and <1 µg/cm2
with 1,4-Butanediol or 1,5-Pentanediol.
Penetration enhancement tests in vitro showed 1,5-Pen-
tanediol to be a penetration enhancer for certain pharma-ceutical drugs.
67,68Test cream formulations containing .1%
triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC; a thyroid hormone analog)and either 1,5-Pentanediol (10%) or propylene glycol (10%)showed 1,5-Pentanediol to be a more effective penetrationenhancer than propylene glycol for TRIAC in a multilayer
membrane system (MMS) experiment.
67Results for 1,5-
Pentanediol indicated that 33% of the TRIAC (pharmaco-logically active agent) was released from the carrier vehicle, orformulation (in MMS), to enable TRIAC to contact the skin atthe epidermal surface by 30 minutes post-application; 62%TRIAC was released from the formulation by 300 minutes.
67
In a separate experiment, test cream formulations containing1% hydrocortisone and either 1,5-Pentanediol (25%) or
propylene glycol (25%) were evaluated using human breast
skin.
Both 1,5-Pentanediol (increa s e dd r u ga b s o r p t i o n4 - f o l d ,
compared to controls) and propylene glycol (increaseddrug absorption 13-fold, compared to controls) were shownto be penetration enhancers.
67However, propylene glycol
enhanced the transfer of the drug through the skin moreeffectively and 1,5-Pentaned iol increased retention of the
drug in the skin more effectively (receptor ﬂuid [ethanol/
phosphate buffered saline (PBS)] collected up to 60 hourspost-application). Another experiment evaluating test
cream formulations containing .1% mometasone furoateand either 1,5-Pentanediol (25%) or Hexylene Glycol(12%) revealed that both formulations were percutaneousabsorption enhancers in human breast skin (receptor ﬂuid
[ethanol/PBS] collected up to 60 hours post-application).
The absorption of .1% mometasone furoate into the skin
was 6% using 1,5-Pentanediol and 7% using HexyleneGlycol as penetration enhancers.Scott et al. 79STable 6. Penetration Enhancement Studies.

lipophilic drug used to treat foot and nail fungus, in a hydrogelformulation.
68Both alkane diols were found to be percuta-
neous absorption enhancers in human breast skin (receptorﬂuid [ethanol/PBS] collected up to 60 hours post-application).
Results indicated that 21% and 11% terbina ﬁne was absorbed
into the skin with 20% propylene glycol or 20% 1,5-Penta-nediol, respectively. The 5% propylene glycol or 5% 1,5-Pentanediol yielded 19 and 52% terbina ﬁne absorption into
skin, respectively. For comparison, the control (1% terbina ﬁne
in hydrogel without either alkane diol) resulted in 8% drugabsorption into the skin.Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion
In mammals, 1,4-Butanediol is metabolized endogenously togamma-hydroxybutyraldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase andthen by aldehyde dehydrogenase to GHB.
61This metabolism
has been reported to occur in rat brain and liver.69Ethanol, a
competitive substrate for alcohol dehydrogenase, can inhibit1,4-Butanediol metabolism.
61,70GHB is metabolized to
succinic semialdehyde by GHB dehydrogenase, and then tosuccinic acid by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase;succinic acid then enters the Krebs cycle.
61Alternatively,
succinic semialdehyde can be metabolized by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase to produce the
neurotransmitter GABA.Table 6. (continued)

In vitro. Competitive inhibition between 1,4-Butanediol
(.5 mM) and ethanol (.5 mM) occurred in a test performedusing horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase.
70In rat liver ho-
mogenates, 10 nmol of diacetyl, acetoin, and 2,3-Butanediol
were interconvertible with a molar equilibrium ratio of 0:3:7,respectively.
71Methylpropanediol was a substrate for rat liver
alcohol dehydrogenase.2
Animal. Metabolism experiments conducted using liver ho-
mogenates from rats that were fed 500 ppm Propanediol in thediet for 15 weeks and control rats (fed a plain diet) revealed
that Propanediol was converted to malondialdehyde
(5.6 nmol/h/100 mg tissue) in the liver homogenates ofPropanediol-exposed rats and controls, but little-to-no con-version occurred in the testicular homogenates of treated orcontrol rats.
72Experiments in rabbits administered single
doses of alkane diols via stomach tube revealed metabolitesisolated from the urine 1 to 3 days post-dosing. Propanediolglucuronic acid conjugation accounted for up to 2% of the
administered dose (4 mmol/kg); 1,4-Butanediol (9 g) was
metabolized to succinic acid (7% of administered dose); 2,3-Butanediol glucuronic acid conjugation accounted for up to26% of the administered dose (4 mmol/kg); phenacyl glutarate(.5% of dose) was identi ﬁed after 1,5-Pentanediol (8.5 g)
administration; Hexanediol glucuronic acid conjugation ac-counted for up to 9% of the administered dose (2 mmol/kg)and adipic acid was detected.
73
Rats were intragastrically exposed to a single dose of 1 g/kg
1,4-Butanediol; 75 minutes post-dosing 96 µg/g were mea-sured in the brain, 52 µg/g in the liver, and 58 µg/g in thekidney; endogenous levels of 1,4-Butanediol in rats dosedwith ethanol were found to be .02 to .05 µg/g (type of tissuenot speci ﬁed), by comparison; 1,4-Butanediol levels in the
liver peaked at 50 µg/g 1.5 to 3 hours post-dosing; sedationand ataxia were observed 30 minutes post-dosing and, by
60 minutes, catalepsy was noted (these effects were syner-
gistically intensi ﬁed when ethanol was concurrently admin-
istered).
70In rats orally administered up to 400 mg/kg
1,4-Butanediol (radiolabels on C1 and C4), >75% of theradioactivity was excreted as [
14C]-CO 2(by 24 hours post-
administration), up to 6% of the radioactivity was excreted inurine (by 72 hours post-administration), and up to .6% of theradioactivity was excreted in feces (by 72 hours post-ad-
ministration).
74Endogenous concentrations of 1,4-Butanediol
in rats were found to be 165 ng/g (stomach) and 30 ng/g (liver)in aqueous phase tissues (i.e., aqueous portion of supernatantof homogenized tissues) and in lipid phase tissues (i.e., lipidportion of supernatant of homogenized tissues) were 150 to180 ng/g.
69
Experiments in rats orally administered 1 M diacetyl,
acetoin or 2,3-Butanediol showed that these compounds in-
terconvert.71Methylpropanediol orally administered to rats(100 or 1000 mg/kg, [14C]-labeled) was rapidly metabolized
and eliminated in the urine as 3-hydroxybutyric acid (31% -45% of dosed radioactivity), in the exhaled breath as CO
2(42 -
57% of dosed radioactivity), and in the feces (<1% of dosedradioactivity).
32,75
In liver perfusion experiments in rats (in vivo), perfusion
with 1 mM 2,3-Butanediol resulted in the oxidation of 2,3-
Butanediol to small amounts of diacetyl and acetoin; 33% ofthe perfused 2,3-Butanediol was metabolized or conjugated inthe liver.
2,71
Human. In human subjects dermally exposed to 25% 1,5-
Pentanediol (2 applications, 12 hours apart), increasing levelsof glutaric acid were detected in urine and serum (no con-
centrations were provided).
64The study authors reported that
the risk of 1,5-Pentanediol accumulation at the concentrationtested (therapeutic dose) was low.
Human subjects orally exposed to 1,4-Butanediol (single
25 mg/kg dosage) in fruit juice exhibited measurable plasmaconcentrations of GHB between 5 and 30 minutes post-dosing, indicating rapid conversion of 1,4-Butanediol toGHB; 4 hours post-dosing plasma levels were below the limit
of quantitation (1 mg/L).
76Clearance of 1,4-Butanediol was
rapid in some subjects and relatively slow in subjects whowere con ﬁrmed to have a genetic mutation of variant alleles
(G143 A single nucleotide-polymorphism of ADH-1B).Lightheadedness, headaches, and increased blood pressurewere observed 15 minutes post-dosing, and reports of subjectsfeeling dizzy or less alert were expressed for up to 4 hourspost-dosing. A study in which human subjects were injected
intravenously with 1,4-Butanediol (15 or 30 mg/kg) showed
rapid and nearly 100% conversion of 1,4-Butanediol to GHB;1,4-Butanediol and GHB had essentially the same decaycurves when equal doses of each were administered.
74In
another study, human subjects were orally administered GHB(single 25 mg/kg dosage) in water; absorption and elimination(linear kinetics) of GHB were rapid.
77Terminal plasma
elimination half-life was 17.4 to 42.5 min. The majority of
subjects showed the highest concentrations in urine 60 min-
utes post-dosing; by 24 hours post-dosing, up to 2% of theadministered dose was recovered in the urine. Confusion,sleepiness, and dizziness were observed, with substantialvariation among the subjects.

dose, no other urinary metabolites were reported; the
authors ’surmised that Propanediol is likely oxidized
completely to CO
2in body;
1,4-Butanediol glucuronic acid conjugation was 0-2% of
dose, urinary metabolite identi ﬁed was succinic acid;
2,3-Butanediol glucuronic acid conjugation was 20%-26%
of dose, glucuronide of the glycol (triacetyl methyl
ester) was the urinary metabolite identi ﬁed;
1,5-Pentanediol had no glucuronic acid conjugation
reported, urinary metabolite identi ﬁed was glutaric acid
(glutaric acid is metabolized to CO 2in body);
Hexanediol glucuronic acid conjugation was 4%-9% of
dose, urinary metabolite identi ﬁed was adipic acid73
1,4-Butanediol Rat Not speci ﬁed 1 g/kg (no further details speci ﬁed) Animals were dosed via stomach tube and the
concentrations of 1,4-Butanediol in brain, liver, kidney,stomach, and pancreas were determined by Gas
Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)
analysis 75 min post-dosing; the same organ
concentrations of 1,4-Butanediol in control rats (na ¨ıve)
were determined similarlyIn na¨ıve rats concentrations were 165 ng/g (stomach) and
30 ng/g (liver) in aqueous phase tissues (aqueousportion of supernatant generated from homogenized
tissues); in lipid phase tissues (lipid portion of
supernatant generated from homogenized tissues)
concentrations ranged from 150 to 180 ng/g in all
organs tested; at 75 min post-dosing 1,4-Butanediol wasdistributed through all organ systems evenly (no further
details regarding concentrations of 1,4-Butanediol in
organs of na ¨ıve or treated animals were provided in the
abstract that is referenced); 1,4-Butanediol is
ubiquitous in lipid membranes and aqueous phase
fractions of the organs analyzed, implying 1,4-Butanediol may be an extraneuronal source for GHB;
1,4-Butanediol is an endogenous hepatotoxin relevant
to alcohol induced liver damage69,70

performed through portal vein to inferior vena cava @
37°C; substrate added to buffer 30 min after perfusionbegan; perfusion was conducted without recirculation;
perfusates collected every 10 min for 1 h, then liver
was removed, homogenized, deproteinized, andassayed for diacetyl, acetoin, and 2,3-ButanediolDiacetyl was reduced to acetoin and 2,3-Butanediol in
liver (mole ratio diacetyl: acetoin: 2,3-Butanediol was 5:
39:100; perfusate showed 45, 15, and 10% of diacetyldose, respectively); diacetyl in perfused liver was .1% of
perfused diacetyl dose so ∼30% was metabolized or
underwent glucuronidation in liver
Acetoin was reduced to 2,3-Butanediol and small amount
oxidized to diacetyl in liver (mole ratio diacetyl: acetoin:
2,3-Butanediol was 1:38:100; perfusate showed 1:15:45

In a control experiment the livers of fed rats were
perfused with 15 mM glucoseExp. 1-In unlabeled 2,3-Butanediol experiments, the
uptake rate (linear) of the RR- form was greater than

meso - form; rate of formation of meso - form from
labeled RR- form was approx. double the rate offormation of labeled RR-, SS- forms produced from
meso -form; uptake of labeled RR- and meso- forms
resulted in formation of
14CO 2, acetate, ketone bodies,
acetoin, and isomers of 2,3-Butanediol, which is
attributed to approx. 1/3 of label uptake; results

LD50s reported for 1,4-Butanediol and Methylpropanediol
were >2 g/kg in dermally exposed rats13and rabbits.20After
dermal exposure to 1,4-Butanediol (5 g/kg) in rats, ﬁndings
included dermal lesions (48 h post-application) and abnor-
malities in the liver (14 days post-application), but no mor-
tality.82Clinical signs observed in rats within 2 hours of
exposure to 2 g/kg 1,4-Butanediol were dyspnea and poorgeneral state; slight erythema was noted 24 hours post-ex-posure.
13One source reported that 1,4-Butanediol was toxic
on the skin, however the quality of the test material wasquestionable; the same source noted that there was no indi-cation of absorption of acutely toxic quantities of 1,4-Buta-
nediol in rabbit skin (no further details provided).
83Clinical
signs reported in rabbits following dermal exposure to 2 g/kgMethylpropanediol (time between exposure and appearance ofsigns not speci ﬁed) were slight erythema, diarrhea, yellow
nasal discharge, bloated abdomen, soiling of anogenital area,gastrointestinal tract abnormalities, and lung and liver ab-normalities.
20By 14 days post-application (2 g/kg Methyl-
propanediol), abnormalities in kidney and gastrointestinal
tract of rabbits were reported at necropsy; there were no
treatment-related mortalities.
Oral. Propanediol, 1,4-Butanediol, 2,3-Butanediol, 1,5-
Pentanediol, Hexanediol, 1,10-Decanediol, Methyl-propanediol, Butyl Ethyl Propanediol, and Isopentyldiol wereevaluated for toxicity in acute oral exposure studies in ani-mals. An approximate lethal dosage (ALD) of 17 g/kg (70%
purity) and >25 g/kg (99.8% purity) and an LD
50of 14.9 mL/
kg were reported in rats dosed with Propanediol; clinicaleffects noted were sluggishness, sedation, ataxia, irregularrespiration, unconsciousness followed by the death of some ofthe animals.
12,35Various animal studies reported an LD 50
between 1.2 and 2.5 g/kg for 1,4-Butanediol.13,22,34,37,74,82
Findings at necropsy in one rat study (animals killed 48 h post-
dosing with 1.8 g/kg 1,4-Butanediol) were ﬂuid-ﬁlled gas-
trointestinal tract and congestion of internal organs, histo-
pathological changes in liver and kidneys, extensive vacuolardegeneration of hepatic parenchyma, granular clusters ofdesquamated cells, and interstitial in ﬁltration of mononuclear
kidney cells.
82In another rat study, 14-days post dosing (1 to
2.5 g/kg 1,4-Butanediol), the animals that survived to nec-ropsy showed no abnormal ﬁndings and an LD
50of 1.5 g/kg
was reported.13Clinical signs observed after 1,4-Butanediol
(1.35 to 2 g/kg dosage) administration in rats included ir-
regular, decreased respiration and catalepsy, dyspnea, apathy,abnormal position, staggering, spastic gait, atony, and unusualpain re ﬂex.
13,82For the following alkane diols, LD 50s were
reported as: >5 g/kg in rats16,34and 9 g/kg49in mice for 2,3-

14-17,20In rats dosed with 10 g/kg 1,5-Pentane-
diol, dilation of the heart and congestive hyperemia, bloodystomach ulcerations, and abnormal bladder content wereobserved at necropsy.
14After dosing with Methylpropanediol
(5 g/kg), 1 rat (n = 10) showed pink bladder ﬂuid at nec-
ropsy.20There were no clinical signs reported in mice dosed
with Isopentyldiol19; at necropsy, rats dosed with Hex-
anediol15or Butyl Ethyl Propanediol17and mice dosed with
1,10-Decanediol84or Isopentyldiol19showed no abnormali-

Inhalation. Studies evaluating the toxicity of Propane-
diol, 1,4-Butanediol, 2,3-Butanediol, 1,5-Pentanediol,Hexanediol, and Methylpropanediol were conducted in ratsexposed by inhalation. An approximate lethal concentra-tion (ALC) was estimated by the authors to be >5 mg/L forPropanediol (4 h exposure time, 3.2 µm mass medianaerodynamic diameter); cl inical signs were wet fur/

Short-Term Toxicity
Below is a summary of the short-term toxicity studies that are
presented in detail in Table 9 .
Animal
Oral. Short-term oral exposure studies were conducted in
animals to investigate the toxicity of Propanediol, 1,4-Bu-tanediol, Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, and Butyl EthylPropanediol. A no-observ ed-effect-level (NOEL) of
1000 mg/kg/day was reported for Propanediol in a 14-day
rat study.
12A 28-day experiment in rats evaluating the
toxicity of 1,4-Butanediol revealed liver abnormalities;NOELs of 500 mg/kg/day (females) and 50 mg/kg/day(males) were reported.
87Another rat study (approxi-
mately 42 days exposure duration) examining 1,4-Buta-nediol, showed lower body weight gains and foodconsumption (400 and 800 mg/kg/day), a statisticallysigniﬁcant dose-related decrease of blood glucose (male
treated animals), and bladder abnormalities (400 and
800 mg/kg/day); a no-observed-adverse-effect-level(NOAEL) of 200 mg/kg/day was reported.

20A NOAEL of 1000 mg/kg/
day was reported for Butyl Ethyl Propanediol in a 28-dayrat experiment; rats exhibited abnormalities of the liver (inmales at 1000 mg/kg/day) and kidney (in males at 150 or1000 mg/kg/day).
17
Inhalation. Short-term inhalation exposure studies were
conducted in animals to evaluate the toxicity of Propanedioland 1,4-Butanediol. A rat study evaluating exposure toPropanediol, up to 1800 mg/L, 6 h/day for 2 weeks (9exposures total), reported no remarkable results.
78A study
in which rats were exposed to 1,4-Butanediol (up to 5.2 mg/L), 6 h/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks showed slight, rednasal discharge at all levels tested (.2, 1.1, 5.2 mg/L), lower
body weights (at 5.2 mg/L only), and abnormal blood
chemistry parameters (at 5.2 mg/L only); a no-observed-adverse-effect-concentration (NOAEC) of 1.1 mg/L wasreported.
85
Subchronic Toxicity
Below is a synopsis of the subchronic toxicity studies that are
presented in detail in Table 9 .Animal
Oral. Propanediol, Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, and
Butyl Ethyl Propanediol were evaluated for toxicity insubchronic (approximately 3-month) studies in rats with oralexposure. A NOEL of 1000 mg/kg/day was reported forPropanediol
88; another evaluation of 5 or 10 mL/kg of
Propanediol resulted in 100% m ortality (5 deaths) at 10 mL/
kg and 2 deaths at 5 mL/kg.12NOAELs for Hexanediol were
reported to be 400 mg/kg/day (males) and 1000 mg/kg/day(females); a treatment-relate d decrease (in males at 1000 mg/
k g / d a y )i nm e a nb o d yw e i g h t s and a statistically signi ﬁcant
increase in relative adrenal g land weights (in males at 400
and 1000 mg/kg/day) and in relative weights of the brain,epididymides, and testes (in males at 1000 mg/kg/day) were
observed.
15A NOEL of 600 mg/kg/day was reported for
Methylpropanediol; abnorma lities seen were decreased liver
enzymes and inorganic phosphate (at 1000 mg/kg/day).20
NOAELs of 150 mg/kg/day (females) and 15 mg/kg/day(males) were reported for Butyl Ethyl Propanediol;there were 4 treatment-related deaths (males at 150 or1000 mg/kg/day), abnormal loc omotion and respiration 1 to
2 hours post-dosing (after which animals returned to nor-
mal), hunched body, and urinary (at 150 and 1000 mg/kg/
day) and kidney abnormalities (at ≥15 mg/kg/day)
reported.
17
Inhalation. In rat studies of 4-month durations (2 h/day
exposure time) evaluating 1 ,4-Butanediol, a NOAEC of
500 mg/L (or NOAEL of 23 mg/kg/day) and a lowest-observed-adverse-effect-concentration (LOAEC) of
1500 mg/L (or lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level,
LOAEL, of 85 mg/kg/day) were reported; observationsin the study reporting the LOAEC of 1500 mg/L included asleepy condition 20 minutes post-exposure, and histo-pathological exam revealed pulmonary emphysema, mildlung edema, treatment-related in ﬂammatory changes of
single alveolar cell and weak hyperplasia of alveolarseptum.
22In 14-wk studies of diacetyl (potential metab-
olite of 2,3-Butanediol) in mice and rats, signi ﬁcant in-
creases in neutrophil c ounts consistent with in ﬂammation
in the respiratory tract were observed at 50 and 100 ppm(mice), and at 100 ppm (rats).
89Signi ﬁcantly increased
incidences of exposure-related, non-neoplastic lesionsoccurred in the respiratory tract of male and female rats andmice, primarily in the 50 and 100 ppm groups; the highestnumber of lesions occurred in the nose.

been skewed by 1 female at those doselevels with atypically high incidences so
the study was repeated; the follow-up

and there was an increase in blood serum transaminases. A
substantial increase in t he auto-diffusion coef ﬁcient of
tissue ﬂuid (herein, owing to variation in the permeability
of cell membranes) was found in the liver and brain withthe 3 and 30 mg/kg dosages. Liminal morphologicalchanges were noted with the 3 mg/kg dosage. At the 30 mg/kg dosage, the morphological changes observed were areduction in Nissl bodies, glia l element growth in cerebral
tissue, fatty dystrophy, hyperemia in organs, and sclerotic
growth in liver.
Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity
(dart) Studies
Provided below is a summary of DART studies that are
presented in detail in Table 10 .
Oral
Developmental and reproductive toxicity studies were
conducted in animals that were orally exposed to Propane-diol, 1,4-Butanediol, Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, orButyl Ethyl Propanediol. In rat studies evaluating Pro-panediol at dose rates up to 1000 mg/kg/day, spermatogenicendpoints were unaffected (9 0-day exposure duration)
88and
no maternal (dosing on days 6 - 15 of gestation) or fetal toxiceffects were observed (maternal and fetal NOAEL 1000 mg/
kg/day).
12In a mouse study evaluating 1,4-Butanediol at up
to 600 mg/kg/day (dosing on days 6 - 15 of gestation), amaternal and developmental NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/dayand a LOAEL of 300 mg/kg/day were reported; maternalcentral nervous system intoxication (300-600 mg/kg/day)and maternal and fetal body weight reduction (maternal300 - 600 mg/kg/day) were observed.
91For male and female
rats dosed with up to 800 mg/kg/day 1,4-Butanediol (14 daysprior to mating and for females through day 3 of lactation),the following were reported: developmental NOEL of
400 mg/kg/day (pup weight slig htly but statistically sig-
niﬁcantly decreased on lactation day 4 at 800 mg/kg/day,
secondary to maternal reduction in body weight), parentaltransient hyperactivity (200 and 400 mg/kg/day) and re-versible parental hypoactivity ( ≥400 mg/kg/day), but no
parental reproductive parameters were changed bytreatment.
13,22A maternal and developmental NOAEL of
1000 mg/kg/day was reported in animal studies on Hex-
anediol (rats dosed on days 6-19 of gestation)15and for
Methylpropanediol (rats dosed on days 0 - 20 of gestation;rabbits on days 0 - 29).
2,32In a rat study evaluating Butyl
Ethyl Propanediol (up to 1000 mg/kg/day on days 6 - 19 ofgestation), a maternal NOAEL of 150 mg/kg/day (reducedactivity, staggering, limb dragging, slow respiration, andreduced food consumption/ body weight at 1000 mg/kg dose)
and a developmental NOAEL of 1000 mg/kg/day were
reported.

homogenates500 ppm Propanediol in the diet For up to 15 weeks, rats were dosed in the diet (control
rats were fed a plain diet); 3 rats/group were killed at5, 10, and 15 weeks; tissues from the liver and onetesticle from each rat were homogenized and assayedto isolate the DNA; bound tryptophan was measured
(effect of DNA concentration on ﬂuorescence was
evaluated); DNA template activity was determined;hepatic and testicular DNA was assayed for cross-linkingThe metabolism results from the homogenized liver and testes
are summarized in the Toxicokinetics Section of this safetyassessment.
No substantial difference in control vs. treated rats was
observed in the evaluation of lipid-soluble testicular
ﬂuorophores; tryptophan bound to testicular DNA of
treated rats was not different from the controls; tryptophanbound to hepatic DNA in treated rats killed at 5 and 15weeks was statistically signi ﬁcantly higher than in
corresponding controls; treated rats showed a statistically
signiﬁcantly lower template activity in hepatic DNA in rats
killed at 10 and 15 weeks compared to controls; templateactivities of testicular DNA showed no difference fromcontrols; in treated rats the hepatic DNA-protein andDNA-crosslinking at 10 and 15 weeks were higher than
controls; testicular DNA-protein and DNA-crosslinking of
treated rats were slightly higher than controls at 15 weeks;given the above results and the toxicokinetics resultspresented in Table 8 (rat liver homogenates converted

In Vivo
Oral. Tests performed in rat liver and testicular homogenates
from rats that were fed 500 ppm Propanediol in the diet for

In the mouse study, mean body weights of the 50 ppm
groups were reduced to 65% (males) and 62% (females) ofthose of the respective chamber control groups. Clinicalobservations, which were most prominent in the 50 ppmgroups, included abnormal breathing, thinness, sneezing,and eye abnormality in both males and females. Adeno-carcinomas occurred in the nose of two female mice at the
50 ppm dose level; nasal adenocarcinomas have not been
recorded historically in the NTP database. Statisticallysigniﬁcant increases in several non-neoplastic lesions were
observed in the nose and larynx (all test groups), the trachea(25 and 50 ppm groups), and the lungs (50 ppm group; mostcommon bronchial lesion in both males and females wasbronchus epithelium regeneration). Effects on the cornea ofthe eye were observed in the 25 and 50 ppm diacetyl
groups. It was concluded that there was no evidence of
carcinogenic activity of diacetyl in male B6C3F1/N mice
exposed to 12.5, 25, or 50 ppm, but there was equivocal
evidence of carcinogenic activity in female B6C3F1/N
mice based on the occurrences of adenocarcinoma of thenose.
In the rat study, survival of males exposed to 50 ppm
diacetyl was signi ﬁcantly less than that of the chamber control
group, and survival was moderately reduced in females ex-
posed to 25 ppm. At the end of the study, mean body weightsof both sexes exposed to 50 ppm were decreased relative to therespective control groups, with more of an effect in males(81% of controls) than in females (91% of controls).Exposure-related clinical observations were reported and in-cluded thinness, abnormal breathing, eye abnormality, andnasal/eye discharge in males and eye abnormality and ab-
normal breathing in females. Three squamous cell carcinomas
and one squamous cell papilloma of the nasal mucosa oc-curred in male rats exposed to 50 ppm, and three squamouscell carcinomas of the nasal mucosa occurred in femalesexposed to 50 ppm; no squamous cell carcinomas or papil-lomas of the nose occurred in the concurrent male or femalecontrols, and none were recorded historically in the NTPdatabase. Statistically signi ﬁcant increases in several non-
neoplastic lesions were observed in the nose, larynx, the
trachea, and the lungs of rats of the 25 and 50 ppm groups.Effects on the cornea of the eye were also observed in rats ofthe 25 and 50 ppm diacetyl groups. It was concluded that therewassome evidence of carcinogenic activity of diacetyl in male
and female Wistar Han rats based on the combined incidencesof squamous cell papilloma and squamous cell carcinoma ofthe nose in males and incidences of squamous cell carcinoma
of the nose of females.106S International Journal of Toxicology 43(Supplement 2)Table 12. Dermal Irritation, Sensitization, and Photoirritation/Photosensitization Studies.

Methylpropanediol Human n=110 (male and female) Both induction and challenge phase concentrations
were 50% aqueous dilution.2 mL of test substance was applied to .75 x .75 in
2patch and
secured between the scapulae; test substance applied 3 times/week for 10 applications total; patches removed 24 h after
application and skin examined 48 h and 72 h after initial
application; 2 weeks following the 10
thapplication a challenge
patch was applied to the initial site and a new site on forearm;patch was removed after 24 h and examined immediately andagain 48 h post-application
If a subject showed a reaction on challenge the subject was re-
challenged 7 days later with 100% and 50% aqueous dilution oftest substance (occlusive and semi-occlusive conditions wereused)At the 9
thand 10thdays during induction “mild dermal
responses ”were observed in 3 subjects indicating irritation
or a potential allergic reaction; another subject exhibited
skin reactions on days 2-19 of inductions indicating a
potential atopic reaction; at challenge 5 subjects showed“mild dermal responses ”24 h and 48 h post-application that
lasted until 72 h post-application; 2 subjects had skinreactions at the forearm site; the re-challenge in 4 subjects
showed mild, well-de ﬁned delayed reactions at 48 h post-
application (occlusive, semi-occlusive showed less reaction);subjects re-challenged with propylene glycol or butyleneglycol (occlusive) showed mild-to-well-de ﬁned reactions at
24 h post-application; it is unclear as to whether irritation,
allergy, or an unrecognizable atopic condition were the
cause of the above reactions; Methylpropanediol was notconsidered to be a strong irritant or potent sensitizer2,32,75
Methylpropanediol Human n= 205 21.2% in facial serum (used during induction and
challenge phases)Induction: .2 mL test substance was applied to a 2 x 2 cm2area of
skin on the left or right infrascapular location of the back or toupper arm under occlusive conditions for 24 h; patch wasremoved 24 h post-application and skin assessed at 48, 72 or 96 h
post-application depending on the occurrence of weekends/
holidays; following assessment, test substance was applied againto same skin area under occlusive conditions and assessed asdescribed above; this process was repeated until 9 applications oftest substance were administered
Rest: Subjects received no treatment during the 10-15 days after
completion of induction and prior to challenge phase
Challenge: at week 6, .2 mL test substance was applied to 2x2c m
2
skin site not previously exposed to test substance during
induction; same procedures for patch removal and skin
assessment were followed as in induction phase; if evidence of
potential sensitization was noted, a rechallenge was conducted;during rechallenge, test substance was applied to skin (previouslyunexposed to test substance) using occlusive and semi-occlusivepatches to distinguish between irritation and sensitization
reactionsStudy researchers stated that test substance was non-
sensitizing and the irritation responses were consideredacceptable
Induction: 41 subjects exhibited de ﬁnite erythema with no
edema, 3 of those subjects also showed damage to
epidermis (a protocol deviation occurred for the 1
stsubject
resulting in an inadvertent discontinued use of testsubstance, 2
ndsubject declined to complete patch tests for
the remainder of study, 3rdsubject showed no further
reactions for remainder of induction phase when test
substance was applied to a new site under semi-occlusiveconditions during 6
thinduction, but subject declined to
participate at challenge); on another day, 31 subjectsshowed de ﬁnite erythema with no edema, and 7 of those
subjects showed damage to epidermis; those 7 subjects did
not experience any additional reactions after test substancewas applied to a new site under semi-occlusive conditions75,101

Cytotoxicity
1,10-Decanediol. An agarose overlay test was performed by
evaluating the diffusion in an agarose gel of a trade namemixture containing 1.2% of 1,10-Decanediol and an un-speciﬁed amount of Butylene Glycol. Average diameters (total

Neurotoxicity
“Hexacarbon neurotoxicity ”describes the ability of n-hexane
and 2-hexanone (methyl n-butyl ketone; M nBK) to produce
structural damage to the central and peripheral nervous sys-
tem.93Both of these compounds are metabolized to similar
metabolites, ie, 2-hexanol, 5-hydroxyl-2-hexanone, 2,5-hexanediol, and 2,5-hexanedione.
942,5-Hexanediol and
2,5-hexanedione are neurotoxic agents, and 2-hexanol and 5-hydroxyl-2-hexanone may be neurotoxic, because they aremetabolized to 2,5-hexanedione.
Peripheral neuropathy develops in several species with
exposure to these 6 metabolically-interrelated hexacarbons.
93
The relative neurotoxicity of these compounds in CharlesRiver CD COBS rats (2,5- hexanedione > 5-hydroxy-2-hexanone > 2,5-hexanediol > M nBK > 2-hexanol > n-hex-
ane) has been attributed to differential serum levels of thecommon metabolite, 2,5- hexanedione, and is in proportion tothe peak serum value that each compound generates.
The speci ﬁc molecular con ﬁguration of the hexacarbon
compounds plays a role in neuropathy.
93Neuropathy did not
develop in Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to the diketones 2,4-
hexanedione, 2,3-hexanedione, 3,5-heptanedione, or 2,6-heptanendione. In addition, the mono-ketone, 2-heptanone,did not produce neuropathy in rats, but 2,5-heptanedione and3,6-octanedione produced neuropathological alterations.
95
These ﬁndings support the requirement for a diketone with
γ-spacing to produce neuropathy. Additional studies sug-
gested that although pyrrole formation is necessary for the
pathogenesis of γ-diketone neuropathy, autoxidation to re-
active intermediates, resulting in inter- or intraneuro ﬁlament
crosslinking, is required for the neurotoxic effects of γ--
diketones to be manifested.96
1,4-Butanediol. Central nervous system effects have been re-
ported for exposures to 1,4-Butanediol.74Central nervous
system depression, anesthetic effect, loss of righting re ﬂex,
struggle response, and voluntary motor activity were docu-
mented in rats administered 496 mg/kg 1,4-Butanediol (nofurther details were provided). During oral, intraperitoneal, orintravenous exposure, neuropharmacologic responses havebeen reported. These effects were also observed after ad-ministration of GHB. Endogenous levels of GHB in the brainof mammals are in micromolar concentrations, while in theliver, heart, and kidneys concentrations are 5 to 10 timeshigher. Although 1,4-Butanediol can be converted to GHB in
the brain, liver, kidney, and heart, the liver has the greatestcapacity (per gram of tissue) to metabolize GHB. When GHBwas administered at dosages exceeding 150 mg/kg in rats, astate of behavioral arrest was observed, with bilaterallysynchronous electroencephalogram readings resembling those
of humans undergoing seizures (non-epileptic).

Sensitization
Animal. Skin sensitization testing of Propanediol, 1,4-Buta-
nediol, 2,3-Butanediol, Hexanediol, 1,10-Decanediol, Meth-
ylpropanediol, Butyl Ethyl Propanediol, and Isopentyldiol
was performed in guinea pigs. Propanediol (2.5% intradermaland 100% epicutaneous concentrations applied at induction,50% epicutaneous and semi-occlusive at challenge) was non-sensitizing;
121,4-Butanediol (10% intradermal and 30%
topical concentrations applied at induction and challenge) wasnon-sensitizing.
822,3-Butanediol (5% intradermal and 50%
epicutaneous concentrations applied at induction, 25% at
challenge) was non-sensitizing, although during epicutaneous
induction animals showed incrustation and con ﬂuent ery-
thema with swelling.16Hexanediol (5% intradermal and 50%
epicutaneous concentrations applied at induction, 25% atchallenge) was non-sensitizing in one test.
15In another test,
strong erythema was reported with Hexanediol challenge (noconcentration speci ﬁed) following induction (sensitization)
with another compound (.2% hydroxyethyl methacrylate).
However no Hexanediol induction (.2%)/Hexanediol chal-
lenge (no concentration speci ﬁed) tests showed a positive
sensitization reaction.
971,10-Decanediol (1.2% in a trade
name mixture containing an unspeci ﬁed amount of Propylene
Glycol or Butylene Glycol) was non-sensitizing in a Buehlertest (1.2% 1,10-Decanediol in trade name mixture used atinduction and .3% 1,10-Decanediol in trade name mixtureused at challenge).
84Methylpropanediol showed mild sensi-
tization potential (10% intradermal to 100% epidermal con-
centrations applied at induction, up to 100% at challenge).20
Butyl Ethyl Propanediol (2.5% intradermal and 100% topicalconcentrations applied at induction, 50% and 100% at chal-lenge) was non-sensitizing.
17Isopentyldiol (10% intradermal
and 100% topical concentrations applied at induction, 50% atchallenge) was non-sensitizing. However, during intradermalinjection at induction and topical induction, moderate and
conﬂuent erythema were observed.
19The alkane diols showed
mild or no sensitization potential and some positive skin ir-ritation reactions were observed during induction.
Human. Clinical skin sensitization studies of Propanediol,
1,4-Butanediol, 1,5-Pentanediol, and Methylpropanediolshowed the following results: Propanediol was non-sensitizing (5% to 75% concentrations applied at induction
and at challenge) with mild erythema reported in 4 subjects of207 during induction (75% only) after the 1
stof 9 applications;
981,4-Butanediol (concentration not speci ﬁed) was non-
sensitizing;221,5-Pentanediol (5% and 25% in different tests)
was non-sensitizing;45Methylpropanediol (concentration not
speciﬁed) was non-sensitizing in one test; in another test
Methylpropanediol (50% aqueous dilution applied at induc-
tion and challenge) showed mild skin sensitization potential,
however the study authors concluded that it was unclear as towhether or not the skin reactions were caused by irritation,allergic response, or an atopic condition.
2,99An additional test
showed that Methylpropanediol (21.2% applied at inductionand challenge) caused erythema and damage to epidermis insome subjects during the induction phase. However, the re-actions were not reproducible after a new skin site was tested
on those subjects under semi-occlusive conditions; Methyl-
propanediol was non-sensitizing in this study.
101The alkane
diols evaluated were non-sensitizing in human skin.
Photoirritation/Photosensitization
Animal. 1,10-Decanediol (1.2% in a trade name mixture also
containing an unspeci ﬁed amount of Butylene Glycol) was
non-phototoxic in guinea pig skin.84Isopentyldiol (undiluted)
was neither a photo-irritant nor a photo-sensitizer when testedin guinea pig skin; positive controls were used in both ex-periments and yielded expected results.
19
Human. 1,5-Pentanediol (5%) was not phototoxic and not
photosensitizing in a 24-hour occlusive patch test performedfollowing long-wave ultraviolet light (UVA)/short-wave ul-
traviolet light (UVB) exposure to the treated skin. The study
authors stated that it does not absorb in UVA range.

Ocular Irritation
Below is a synopsis of ocular irritation studies that are pre-
sented in detail in Table 13 .
In Vitro
1,10-Decanediol (1.2% in a trade name mixture also con-
taining an unspeci ﬁed amount of Butylene Glycol) was
evaluated in a hen ’s egg experiment and found to have
moderate irritation potential when tested on the chorioallan-toic membrane.
84The same 1,10-Decanediol test substance
was also evaluated on reconstructed human corneal epithelium
in vitro and found to be non-irritating.
Animal
Ocular irritation was evaluated in rabbit eyes for Propanediol,
1,4-Butanediol, 2,3-Butanediol, 1,5-Pentanediol, Hexanediol,1,10-Decanediol, Methylpropanediol, Butyl Ethyl Propane-diol, and Isopentyldiol. No-to-slight irritation (resolved within
48 hours post-application) was reported for undiluted118S International Journal of Toxicology 43(Supplement 2)Table 14. Case Reports.

each of Test 2 and
Test 3Test 2: .5%, 5%, and 10% 1,5-Pentanediol (in
water); .1%, 1%, and 10% resveratrol (in
70% ethanol); 10 controls were patch
tested with the doses of test substancesabove
Test 3: .1%, 1%, and 5% resveratrol (in
petrolatum); 10 more control subjectswere patch tested with same doses of
resveratrol in Test 3A patient was prescribed a resveratrol-containing cream
(also contained 1,5-Pentanediol, concentration not
speci ﬁed) for recurrent scaling erythematous
dermatitis; dermatitis intensi ﬁed after 2 weeks of
cream application; after use of cream was discontinued
eczema eventually cleared
Patient underwent patch testing (Test 1: propylene glycol
and the resveratrol cream unchanged were applied)
4 months later an additional patch test (Test 2) was
performed on the patient and controls using the
ingredients in the resveratrol cream
Aﬁnal patch test (Test 3) was performed on the patient
and controls using resveratrol diluted in petrolatumTest 1 on patient: the resveratrol cream produced +/++ reactions by days 2
and 3
Test 2 on patient and controls: patient had strong reaction to 1,5-
Pentanediol (++ with 5% and 10% doses and +/++ with .5% dose); patienthad slight reactions to resveratrol showing erythema on days 2 and 3 with
all dose levels; 9 of 10 controls were negative and 1 control subject
developed slight erythema with all doses levels of 1,5-Pentanediol andresveratrol (this control subject had not been previously exposed to
resveratrol and had no prior reactions to cosmetics, but did report
hyperirritable skin type)
Test 3 on patient and controls: patient reacted to 5% resveratrol only (+ by
days 2 and 3); controls were negative
Final conclusion: patient was diagnosed with allergic contact dermatitis from
resveratrol containing cream attributed to sensitization to 1,5-
Pentanediol and potential co-sensitization to resveratrol104
1,5-Pentanediol 56 yr old female;

performed; patient had a positive reaction to cream
but not to other series tested; 2 months later patch
testing was conducted with ingredients in cream, but
had no reaction; patient began using another lotion
and developed facial dermatitis; patch testing wasconducted with cream and lotion, which both
produced positive responses; propylene glycol
ingredient in lotion caused a positive reaction; patientwas retested with cream because it contained 1,5-
PentanediolPatient was negative to 1,5-Pentanediol in patch test, but exhibited a positive
reaction to 1,5-Pentanediol in repeated open application test (3 control

dentin primers (by wt %): 62.5% EthyleneGlycol; 45% Hexanediol; 35%
Hydroxyethyl methacrylateA dentist worked with ethylene glycol dentin primer for
a year, which required repeated dermal contact withthe compound; this dermal contact resulted in 2
months of symptoms including cracked ﬁngertip skin,
reddening desquamation, desiccation and
inﬂammatory dolori ﬁc sclerosis; she was diagnosed
with (irritant) contact dermatitis; a patch test wasperformed on the dentist with the test compounds
indicated; test compounds were soaked into a cotton
patch and occlusively applied to healthy brachial skinfor 48 h; 48 h post-application the patches were
removed and skin was examined immediately, 24, and
48 h after patch removalSlight erythema was noted with ethylene glycol 48 h after patch removal;
study researchers noted that dental professionals sensitized tohydroxyethyl methacrylate should take precautions if using Hexanediol in
a dentin primer (no further patch test results speci ﬁed); other supporting
tests in animals were conducted in conjunction with this case report

1,4-Butanediol n ≥8 (14 months to
10 yrs old)Approximately 14% of extractable 1,4-
Butanediol by weightChildren developed vomiting, ataxia, self-limited coma
after swallowing small, colored plastic beads (sold in
toy craft kits); in biological samples collected from
some of the children GHB was found; in 2007 avoluntary recall of the beads was issued by the US
Consumer Product Safety Commission; investigation
determined that 1,4-Butanediol had been substituted
for the more expensive 1,5-Pentanediol (used in glues)
in the plastic beads; 1,4-Butanediol converts to GHB inthe bodySmall, plastic toy beads were found to have 14% 1,4-Butanediol and no 1,5-
Pentanediol or GHB; clinical signs reported were consistent with
ingestion of several dozen of the plastic toy beads containing 1,4-
Butanediol (approximately 9-12 mg of 1,4-Butanediol per bead)107
1,4-Butanediol 8 patients (22 to 51
yrs old)Non-fatal cases of 1,4-Butanediol ingestion
were 1 to 14 g; Fatalities occurred at doses
between 5.4 to 20 gPatients having toxic effects from oral ingestion of 1,4-
Butanediol were identi ﬁed (from emergency room
department visits and/or from public health of ﬁcials
and family members); analysis of 1,4-Butanediol and/or
GHB in urine, serum, or blood was performed and/or
hospital records or autopsy reports were examinedPatients ingested 1,4-Butanediol for recreational use, enhancement during
body building, or for the treatment of depression or insomnia; evidence of
addiction and withdrawal were seen in some cases; clinical signs includedvomiting, urinary and fecal incontinence, agitation, combativeness, labile
level of consciousness, respiratory depression, and death; in 6 patients (2
of whom died) no additional toxicants were detected; the 2 other patientsreported that they did not ingest other toxicants; GHB was detected in
blood, serum, and urine at levels exceeding normal concentrations; 1,4-
Butanediol was not detected in non-fatal cases potentially because
ingested doses were smaller, conversion to GHB in the body is rapid, and
there were limits on detection of the assay used108
1,4-Butanediol 1 male (44 yrs old) Unknown A man was taken to the emergency room with signs of

contain 1,4-Butanediol13
1,4-Butanediol n=1 Unknown A patient ingested an illicit product called ‘liquid ecstasy ’;
blood, urine, and gastric content were analyzed for
1,4-Butanediol and GHB by immunoassay and GC-MS;identi ﬁcation of the ‘liquid ecstasy ’substance was
determined by GC-MSThe ‘liquid ecstasy ’substance was found to contain 1,4-Butanediol; in the
patient 1,4-Butanediol was found at 82 µg/mL (in blood), 401 µg/mL (in

(concentration not speci ﬁed) was non-irritating.19Generally,
the alkane diols were non-to-mildly irritating, with the ex-ception that Butyl Ethyl Propanediol was irritating.
Clinical Studies
1,5-Pentanediol
A controlled, double-blind comparative study was conducted
to evaluate the treatment of atopic dermatitis with hydro-cortisone and 1,5-Pentanediol.
102Patients with atopic der-
matitis were treated 2x/day with either 1% hydrocortisone (n =31) or 1% hydrocortisone with 25% 1,5-Pentanediol (n = 32)
in a cream formulation for 6 weeks. Quantitative bacteria
cultures were taken for Staphylococcus aureus (commonly
seen in the skin of atopic dermatitis patients) from the lesionalskin prior to treatment and at weeks 2, 4, and 6 of treatment.The results indicated that the hydrocortisone-only formulationwas effective for 68% of the patients in that test group; thehydrocortisone plus 1,5-Pentanediol formulation was effec-tive for 69% in that group. There was a statistically signi ﬁcant
reduction in S. aureus (baseline to week 2 and baseline to
week 6) in the hydrocortisone plus 1,5-Pentanediol group,which was not observed in the hydrocortisone-only group.There were 2 instances in each treatment group of “slight
burning sensation ”following cream application. The study
authors noted that bacteria are not likely to develop resistanceto 1,5-Pentanediol because of the interaction of diols onmembranes.
The therapeutic effect of 1,5-Pentanediol was investi-
gated for the treatment of herpes simplex labialis (cold sorevirus) in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blindclinical trial.
103Patients included in the trial were those
with known, frequent recurrences of herpes labialis. Thetreatment group (n = 53) received 25% 1,5-Pentanediol in agel formulation, which was applied to both lips (.04 g total/day) during the 26-week prophylactic evaluation. The
placebo group (n = 52) received the same gel formulation
without 1,5-Pentanediol for 26 weeks. During the occur-rence of herpes labialis episodes the treatment gel orp l a c e b ow a sa p p l i e dt ob o t hl i p s( . 1 6gt o t a l / d a y )f o r5d a y sand then the prophylactic treat ment resumed until the next
herpes episode. The herpes episodes reported during thetrial were 109 for the trea tment group and 120 for the
placebo group. 1,5-Pentanediol did not demonstrate aprophylactic effect, compared to the placebo, in preventingthe recurrence of herpes labialis. However, there was a
statistically signi ﬁcant improvement in blistering, swell-
ing, and pain for the therapeutic use of 1,5-Pentanediol ascompared to the placebo. There were no treatment-relatedadverse events attributable to 1,5-Pentanediol or the pla-cebo reported. In the treatment and placebo groups, bodyweight and temperature, heart rate, and clinical parameterswere nearly unchanged.

Risk Assessment
Occupational Standards
1,4-Butanediol. In Germany, the occupational limit value for
1,4-Butanediol is 50 mL/m3(ppm) or 200 mg/m3.109
Diacetyl (potential metabolite of 2,3-Butanediol). As of 2012, the
American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists(ACGIH) threshold limit value (TLV) for diacetyl is .01 ppm(.04 mg/m
3) time-weighted average (TWA) and .02 ppm
(.07 mg/m3) short-term exposure limit (STEL); diacetyl has an
A4 classi ﬁcation (not classi ﬁable as a human carcinogen).110
A permissible exposure limit (PEL) has not been established
by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA).
In 2016, the US National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health (NIOSH) established a recommended exposurelimit (REL) of 5 ppb for diacetyl as a TWA for up to 8 h/dayduring a 40-h work week.
111NIOSH recommends a STEL for
diacetyl of 25 ppb for a 15-minute time period.
Summary
The 10 alkane diols included in this safety assessment re-portedly function in cosmetics as solvents, humectants, and
skin conditioning agents.Scott et al. 121SVCRP data received from the FDA in 2018 indicated that
the highest reported uses are for Propanediol (1528 uses), andMethylpropanediol (570 uses). The Council industry surveydata from 2015 indicated that the highest maximum useconcentration in leave-on products was 39.9% Propanediol innon-spray deodorants.
1,4-Butanediol and Hexanediol are permitted as indirect
food additives. The FDA has issued warnings about dietarysupplements containing 1,4-Butanediol because of associatedadverse health effects, including death. 1,4-Butanediol isconsidered to be a Class I Health Hazard by the FDA, as wellas a Schedule I Controlled Substance Analog by the DEA, ifillicit human consumption is intended.
A permeability coef ﬁcient of 1.50 × 10
/C05cm/h was cal-
culated for Propanediol after abdominal skin from human
cadavers was exposed for 48 hours in a static diffusion cell to a1.059 g/mL Propanediol solution (in ﬁnite dose, 99.953%
purity).
The ability of Propanediol, 1,4-Butanediol, or 1,5-Penta-
nediol to enhance the penetration of the drug estradiol (.12%[
3H]-estradiol in 1:10 alkane diol/ethanol solution) in human
skin was evaluated in an in vitro experiment using a Franz
diffusion cell. After ∼85 - 90 minutes the permeability of
[3H]-estradiol in human skin was determined to be ∼5-6µ g /
cm2with Propanediol and <1 µg/cm2with 1,4-Butanediol or
1,5-Pentanediol. In vitro tests of pharmaceutical formulationscontaining .1% mometasone furoate and 25% 1,5-Pentanediolor 1% hydrocortisone and 25% 1,5-Pentanediol or 1% ter-binaﬁne and either 5% or 20% 1,5-Pentanediol, showed that
1,5-Pentanediol was a penetration enhancer in human breast
skin samples exposed to the formulations for 60 hours.
1,4-Butanediol was a competitive inhibitor of ethanol
metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase. Diacetyl, acetoin, and2,3-Butanediol were interconvertible with a molar equilibriumratio of 0:3:7, respectively, in rat liver homogenates. Meth-ylpropanediol was demonstrated to be a substrate for alcoholdehydrogenase in vitro.
Rat liver homogenates metabolized Propanediol to yield
malondialdehyde in treated rats (500 ppm in the diet for
15 weeks) and in control rats (plain diet). A single dose ofPropanediol, 1,4-Butanediol, 2,3-Butanediol, or Hexanedioladministered orally to rabbits yielded the correspondingglucuronic acid conjugates in the urine representing 2 to 26%of the administered dose. Orally administered 1,4-Butanedioland 1,5-Pentanediol produced succinic acid and phenacylglutarate, respectively, in the urine.
Endogenous concentrations of 1,4-Butanediol in rats were
30 to 165 ng/g in aqueous phase tissues (aqueous portion ofsupernatant generated from homogenized tissues) and 150 to180 ng/g in lipid phase tissues (lipid portion of supernatantgenerated from homogenized tissues). 1,4-Butanediol con-centrations were 96 µg/g, 52 µg/g, and 58 µg/g in the brain,liver, and kidney, respectively, of rats 75 minutes after oralexposure to 1 g/kg 1,4-Butanediol. In rats orally exposed to up
to 400 mg/kg 1,4-Butanediol (radiolabels on C1 andC4), >75% of the radioactivity was excreted as [
14C]-CO 2by
24 hours post-dosing; up to 6% was eliminated in feces 72hours post-dosing. Experiments in rats orally administered 1Mdiacetyl, acetoin, or 2,3-Butanediol showed interconversionamong these compounds in vivo. Methylpropanediol (100 or1000 mg/kg, [
14C]-labeled) orally administered to rats was
reported to be rapidly metabolized and eliminated as 3-
hydroxybutyric acid in the urine (31% - 45% dosed radio-activity), as CO
2in exhaled breath (42% - 57%), and in the
feces (<1% dosed radioactivity).
In human subjects dermally exposed to 25% 1,5-Penta-
nediol (2 applications, 12 hours apart), increasing levels ofglutaric acid were detected in urine and serum (no concen-trations were provided). Oral exposure to 25 mg/kg 1,4-Bu-
tanediol resulted in measurable plasma concentrations of GHB
in human subjects within 5 to 30 minutes after exposure,indicating rapid conversion of 1,4-Butanediol to GHB; GHBconcentrations were below the limit of quantitation within4 hours. Clearance of 1,4-Butanediol was rapid in somesubjects and relatively slow in others; the latter were con-ﬁrmed to have a genetic mutation of variant alleles of ADH-
1B. Nearly 100% of 1,4-Butanediol was rapidly converted to
GHB in a study in which 15 or 30 mg/kg 1,4-Butanediol was
intravenously injected into human subjects.
Dermal exposure animal studies evaluating the toxicity of
the alkane diols indicated an LD
50>20 g/kg in rats for
Propanediol, >20 mL/kg in rabbits for 1,5-Pentanediol, >10 g/kg in rabbits for Hexanediol, and >2 g/kg in rabbits for ButylEthyl Propanediol. A single dermal exposure to 5 g/kg 1,4-Butanediol caused dermal lesions within 48 hours and liver
abnormalities within 14 days, but no mortalities in rats. In
rabbits, a single 2 g/kg dermal application of Methyl-propanediol caused kidney, lung, liver, and gastrointestinaltract abnormalities, among other effects, but no mortalities.
Acute oral LD
50s reported in multiple studies of mammalian
test species included 14.9 mL/kg Propanediol, 1.2 to 2.5 g/kg1,4-Butanediol, 10 g/kg 1,5-Pentanediol, 3 g/kg Hexanediol, 3to 5 g/kg Butyl Ethyl Propanediol, >.20 mL/kg 1,10-Dec-
anediol (1.2% in a 20 mL/kg trade name mixture also con-
taining unspeci ﬁed amounts of Propylene Glycol), and ≥5g / k g
for 2,3-Butanediol, Methylpropanediol and Isopentyldiol.
A single, 4-hour inhalation exposure of 2000 to 5000 mg/L
Propanediol caused moderate weight loss but no deaths in rats.A single 4.6 to 15 mg/L exposure to 1,4-Butanediol resulted inlethargy, labored breathing, and lung noise/dry nasal dischargein rats 1 to 9 days post-dosing, and 1 death at 15 mg/L 1 day
post-dosing. Rats exposed for 4 hours to 5.1 mg/L 1,4-Bu-
tanediol exhibited shallow respiration that resolved within48 hours post-exposure; gross pathology examination re-vealed no abnormalities. No deaths were reported after asingle 7- to 8-hour inhalation exposure to 2,3-Butanediol (upto .85 mg/L in air), 1,5-Pentanediol (concentrated vapor), orHexanediol (concentrated vapor). An LC
50> 5.1 g/L for
inhalation (duration of inhalation not speci ﬁed) was reported
for Methylpropanediol.122S International Journal of Toxicology 43(Supplement 2)Reported NOELs and NOAELs for short-term oral ex-
posures in rats included 200 mg/kg/day 1,4-Butanediol(∼42 days), 500 mg/kg/day 1,4-Butanediol in females and
50 mg/kg/day in males (28 days), and 1000 mg/kg/dayPropanediol and Methylpropanediol (14 days) or Hex-anediol and Butyl Ethyl Propanediol (28 days). The 28-day
experiment in rats evaluating the toxicity of 1,4-Butanediol
revealed liver abnormalities in treated animals. The rat study(approximately 42 days exposure duration) examining 1,4-Butanediol, showed lower body weight gains and food con-sumption (400 and 800 mg/kg/day), a statistically signi ﬁcant
dose-related decrease of blood glucose (male treated animals),and bladder abnormalities (400 and 800 mg/kg/day). The 28-day experiment evaluating oral exposure to Butyl Ethyl
Propanediol in rats resulted in abnormalities in the liver (in
males at 1000 mg/kg/day) and kidney (in males at 150 or1000 mg/kg/day). Rabbits orally exposed to Hexanediol (up to2000 mg/kg for 25 doses, duration unknown) exhibitedthrombosis and treatment-related effects (unspeci ﬁed) on the
liver and kidneys.
Results were unremarkable in a study in which rats inhaled
up to 1800 mg/L Propanediol, 6 h/day, for 2 weeks (9 total
exposures). Rats exposed to up to 5.2 mg/L 1,4-Butanediol,
6 h/day, 5 days/week, for 2 weeks, showed slight red nasaldischarge (at levels .2, 1.1, and 5.2 mg/L), lower body weights(at 5.2 mg/L only), and abnormal blood chemistry parameters(at 5.2 mg/L only); a 1.1 mg/L NOAEC was reported.
The NOAELs reported in subchronic oral exposure studies
were 15 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day Butyl Ethyl Pro-panediol (90 days) in male and female rats, respectively. In 90-
day studies, a NOAEL of 600 mg/kg/day was reported for
Methylpropanediol and NOAELs of 1000 mg/kg/day werereported for Propanediol and Hexanediol (in females; 400 mg/kg/day NOAEL in males) in oral exposure studies in rats. Anevaluation of oral exposure to 5 or 10 mL/kg Propanediol for15 weeks in rats resulted in 100% mortality (5 deaths) at10 mL/kg and 2 deaths at 5 mL/kg. In the male rats dosed withHexanediol, mentioned above, a treatment-related decrease (in
males at 1000 mg/kg/day) in mean body weights and a sta-
tistically signi ﬁcant increase in organ weights (in males at 400
and 1000 mg/kg/day) were observed. The rats dosed withMethylpropanediol showed decreased liver enzymes and in-organic phosphate (at 1000 mg/kg/day). In rats dosed withButyl Ethyl Propanediol, there were 4 treatment-related deaths(males at 150 or 1000 mg/kg/day), abnormal respiration 1 to2 hours post-dosing (after which animals returned to normal),
and urinary (at 150 and 1000 mg/kg/day) and kidney ab-
normalities (at ≥15 mg/kg/day) reported.
In subchronic inhalation studies, rats were exposed to 1,4-
Butanediol 2 hours/day for 4 months; a NOAEC of 500 mg/L(equivalent to approximately 23 mg/kg/day) and a LOAEC of1500 mg/L (equivalent to about 85 mg/kg/day) were reported.Effects at the reported LOAEC included a sleepy condition20 minutes after each exposure and a histopathological exam
revealed pulmonary abnormalities. In 14-wk studies ofdiacetyl (potential metabolite of 2,3-Butanediol) in mice and
rats, signi ﬁcant increases in neutrophil counts consistent with
inﬂammation were observed at 50 and 100 ppm (mice) and at
100 ppm (rats). Signi ﬁcantly increased incidences of
exposure-related, non-neoplastic lesions occurred in the re-spiratory tract of male and female rats and mice, primarily in
the 50 and 100 ppm groups, and the highest number of lesions
occurred in the nose.
In a chronic study, rats were orally exposed to .25, 3, or
30 mg/kg 1,4-Butanediol for 6 months. At the 30 mg/kgdosage, blood cholinesterase activity was reduced, the ratioof blood serum protein fractions changed, the –SH (thiol)
groups in whole blood and the brain decreased, liver glycogenand choline esterase activity decreased, vitamin C in organs
decreased, and there was an increase in blood serum trans-
aminases. A substantial increase in the auto-diffusion coef-ﬁcient of tissue ﬂuid was found in the liver and brain with the 3
and 30 mg/kg dosages. At the 30 mg/kg dosage, the mor-phological changes were observed.
In rat studies evaluating oral Propanediol exposures up to
1000 mg/kg/day, spermatogenic endpoints were unaffected(90-day exposure) and no maternal or fetal toxic effects were
observed (dosing on days 6-15 of gestation). A NOAEL of
100 mg/kg/day and a LOAEL of 300 mg/kg/day 1,4-Buta-nediol were reported for maternal (dosing on days 6-15 ofgestation) and developmental toxicity in an oral exposuremouse study; maternal central nervous system intoxicationand maternal and fetal body weight reduction were observed atthe LOAEL. Results reported in male and female rats orallyexposed to 1,4-Butanediol for 14 days before mating and, with
dosing continuing in females through day 3 of lactation, in-
cluded a developmental NOEL of 400 mg/kg/day (pup weightwas slightly, but statistically signi ﬁcantly decreased on lac-
tation day 4 at 800 mg/kg/day, effect was secondary to ma-ternal reduction in body weight), parental transienthyperactivity (at 200 and 400 mg/kg/day) and reversibleparental hypoactivity ( ≥400 mg/kg/day), but no parental re-
productive parameters were changed by treatment. A NOAEL
of 1000 mg/kg/day Hexanediol (dosing on days 6-19 of
gestation) and Methylpropanediol (dosing on days 0-29 ofgestation) was reported in oral exposure studies for maternaland developmental effects in rats. In another oral exposurestudy, the NOAEL for maternal effects was 150 mg/kg/dayButyl Ethyl Propanediol in rats (dosing on days 6-19 ofgestation); 1000 mg/kg/day caused staggering, slow respira-tion, and reduced food consumption and body weights in the
dams. The NOAEL for developmental effects was 1000 mg/
kg/day Butyl Ethyl Propanediol in this study.
Genotoxicity experiments conducted in vitro evaluating
Propanediol were negative in a mammalian cell gene mutationassay (up to 5000 µg/mL), a chromosomal aberration test (upto 5000 µg/mL), and an Ames test (up to 5000 µg/plate).Another mammalian chromosomal aberration test (2500 µg/mL, without metabolic activation) that evaluated Propanediol
resulted in positive responses for genotoxicity, however theScott et al. 123Ssame test (up to 5000 µg/mL Propanediol) performed with
metabolic activation yielded negative results. 1,4-Butanediolwas negative for genotoxicity in a Salmonella typhimurium
mutagenicity test (up to 10,000 µg/plate), in an Ames test (upto 10,000 µg/plate), in a mammalian cell gene mutation assay(up to 5000 µg/mL), and in a chromosomal aberration test (up
to 5000 µg/mL). 2,3-Butanediol was negative in an Ames II ™
test (up to 5000 µg/mL). In an Ames test (up to 5000 µg/plate)1,5-Pentanediol was negative for genotoxicity. Hexanediolwas negative for genotoxicity in an Ames test (up to 5000 µg/plate), in a mammalian chromosomal aberration test (up to1.2 µg/mL), and in a mammalian cell gene mutation assay (upto 5000 µg/mL). 1,10-Decanediol (1.2% in a trade namemixture also containing unspeci ﬁed amounts of Propylene
Glycol or Butylene Glycol) was negative in an Ames test (up
to∼120 µg/plate 1,10-Decanediol). Methylpropanediol was
negative in a reverse mutation assay (up to 5000 µg/plate) andin a chromosomal aberration test (up to 5000 µg/plate). ButylEthyl Propanediol was negative for genotoxicity in an Amestest (up to 5000 µg/plate) and in a mammalian cell genemutation assay (up to 7.2 mmol/L); Isopentyldiol was negativefor genotoxicity in an Ames test (up to 10,000 µg/plate) and in
a liquid suspension assay (up to 100 mg/plate). Tests per-
formed in rat liver and testicular homogenates from rats thatwere fed 500 ppm Propanediol in the diet for 15 weeks(controls fed plain diet), showed that the hepatic DNA-proteinand DNA-crosslinking at 10 and 15 weeks were higher thancontrols, and the testicular DNA-protein and DNA-crosslinking of treated rats were slightly higher than con-trols at 15 weeks. The study authors concluded that Pro-
panediol was converted to malondialdehyde in vivo, causing
damage to rat DNA. Mouse micronucleus tests conductedin vivo were non-mutagenic for Propanediol (single dose of2150 mg/kg bw) and for Butyl Ethyl Propanediol (single doseup to 1250 mg/kg).
Carcinogenicity studies data on alkane diol ingredients
were not found in the published literature, and unpublisheddata were not submitted. An inhalation study was conducted
by NTP in which B6C3F1/N mice and Wistar Han [CRL:WI
(Han)] rats were exposed to diacetyl vapor by whole bodyinhalation at concentrations up to 50 ppm, for 6 hours and12 min/day, 5 days/wk, for 105 wks. In mice, there was noevidence of carcinogenic activity of diacetyl in males, butthere was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in fe-males, based on the occurrences of adenocarcinoma of thenose. In rats, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity
of diacetyl in males and females based on the combined in-
cidences of squamous cell papilloma and squamous cellcarcinoma of the nose in males and incidences of squamouscell carcinoma of the nose of females.
The degree of structural damage induced by certain hex-
acarbon compounds (6-carbon compounds) to the central andperipheral nervous system has been attributed to differentialserum levels of the common metabolite, 2,5-hexanedione. The
production of neuropathy is dependent on the speci ﬁcmolecular con ﬁguration of hexacarbon compounds, and a
γ-spacing of the two keto groups is needed. Additionally, it is
suggested that although pyrrole formation is necessary for thepathogenesis of γ-diketone neuropathy, autoxidation to re-
active intermediates, resulting in inter- or intraneuro ﬁlament
crosslinking, is required for the neurotoxic effects of
γ-diketones to be manifested.
1,10-Decanediol (1.2% in a trade name mixture also
containing an unspeci ﬁed amount of Butylene Glycol) was
non-irritating in an in vitro test evaluating the test substance onreconstructed human epidermis.
Undiluted Propanediol, 1,4-Butanediol, 2,3-Butanediol,
1,5-Pentanediol, or Isopentyldiol was non-irritating to slightlyor minimally irritating to the skin of rabbits in 20-to 24-hour
patch tests. Undiluted 1,4-Butanediol was minimally irritating
when applied to rabbit ears. Hexanediol was non-irritating toguinea pig skin (45% test substance applied) and rabbit skin(80% test substance applied) in 24-hour patch tests. 1,10-Decanediol (1.2% in trade name mixture also containing anunspeci ﬁed amount of Propylene Glycol) was non-irritating to
rabbit skin in a 24 h occlusive patch test. Methylpropanediol(concentration not speci ﬁed) was non-irritating to rabbit skin.
Undiluted Butyl Ethyl Propanediol was non-to-mildly irri-
tating to rabbit skin in 4-hour semi-occlusive patch tests.
A single, dermal application of undiluted Propanediol was
non-irritating in human subjects (no further details). 1,4-Butanediol was non-irritating in a patch test on human sub-jects (concentration not speci ﬁed). 1,5-Pentanediol (5%) was
non-irritating in a 24-hour occlusive patch test in humansubjects. 1,10-Decanediol (1.2% in trade name mixture also
containing an unspeci ﬁed amount of Butylene Glycol) was
well-tolerated, according to study authors (2 subjects showedmild erythema 1 h following patch removal) in a 48-hourocclusive patch test. Methylpropanediol (100%, 50% aqueousdilution) was non-irritating to subjects with sensitive skin in a14-day cumulative irritation study. Slight irritation was ob-served in a 48-hour Finn chamber skin test evaluating un-speciﬁed concentrations of Isopentyldiol. Generally, the
alkane diols were non-to-slightly irritating in human skin.
The following treatments were negative in tests for the
induction of dermal sensitization in guinea pigs: Propanediol(2.5% intradermal and 100% epicutaneous concentrationsapplied at induction, 50% at challenge), 1,4-Butanediol (10%intradermal and 30% topical concentrations applied at in-duction and challenge), 2,3-Butanediol (5% intradermal and50% epicutaneous concentrations applied at induction, 25% at
challenge), Hexanediol (5% intradermal and 50% epicuta-
neous concentrations applied at induction, 25% at challenge),1,10-Decanediol (1.2% in a trade name mixture containing anunspeci ﬁed amount of Propylene Glycol or Butylene Glycol)
in a Buehler test (1.2% 1,10-Decanediol in trade name mixtureused at induction and .3% 1,10-Decanediol in trade namemixture used at challenge), Butyl Ethyl Propanediol (2.5%intradermal and 100% topical concentrations applied at in-
duction, 50% and 100% at challenge), and Isopentyldiol (10%124S International Journal of Toxicology 43(Supplement 2)intradermal and 100% topical concentrations applied at in-
duction, 50% at challenge). In another test, strong erythemawas reported in guinea pigs with Hexanediol challenge (noconcentration speci ﬁed) following induction (sensitization)
with another compound (.2% hydroxyethyl methacrylate);however no Hexanediol induction (.2%)/Hexanediol chal-
lenge (no concentration speci ﬁed) tests showed a positive
sensitization reaction. Methylpropanediol showed mild sen-sitization potential in guinea pigs (10% intradermal to 100%epidermal concentrations applied at induction, up to 100% atchallenge).
Propanediol (5 to 75% concentrations applied at induction
and challenge) was non-sensitizing in human subjects; milderythema was reported in 4 subjects during induction (75%
only) after the 1
stof 9 applications. 1,4-Butanediol (con-
centration not speci ﬁed), and 1,5-Pentanediol (5% or 25% in
different tests) were non-sensitizing in human subjects.Methylpropanediol (undiluted) was non-sensitizing in one testand showed mild skin sensitization potential in another test(50% aqueous dilution applied at induction and challenge).However, the study authors concluded that it was unclear as towhether or not the skin reactions were caused by irritation,
allergy, or an atopic condition. An additional study showed
that Methylpropanediol (21.2% applied at induction andchallenge) induced erythema and damage to epidermis insome subjects during induction, however the reactions dis-continued after a new skin site in those subjects was testedunder semi-occlusive conditions; Methylpropanediol wasnon-sensitizing in that study. Overall, the alkane diols werenon-sensitizing to human subjects.
1,10-Decanediol (1.2% in a trade name mixture also
containing an unspeci ﬁed amount of Butylene Glycol) was
non-phototoxic in guinea pig skin. Undiluted Isopentyldiolwas neither a photo-irritant nor a photo-sensitizer when testedin guinea pig skin.
Human subjects were treated with 1,5-Pentanediol (5%) on the
forearms, followed by UVA/UVB exposure. Results from a 24-
hour occlusive patch test to the treated skin revealed that the test
substance was non-phototoxic a nd non-photosensitizing.
Experiments evaluating 1,10-Decanediol (1.2% in a trade
name mixture also containing an unspeci ﬁed amount of
Butylene Glycol) performed in vitro showed moderate irri-tation potential in a hen ’s egg test, and was non-irritating in a
test on reconstructed human corneal epithelium.
Undiluted Propanediol, 1,4-Butanediol, 2,3-Butanediol,
1,5-Pentanediol, and Hexanediol were non-to-slightly irri-
tating or mildly irritating in rabbit eyes. 1,10-Decanediol
(1.2% in a trade name mixture also containing an unspeci ﬁed
amount of Propylene Glycol) was slightly irritating to rabbiteyes. Methylpropanediol (undiluted) was non-irritating torabbit eyes. Isopentyldiol was also non-irritating to rabbit eyes(concentration not speci ﬁed). In contrast, undiluted Butyl
Ethyl Propanediol caused severe injury in rabbit eyes, in-cluding irritation, corneal opaci ﬁcation, partial eyelid ever-
sion, all of which were reversible.In a 6-week study investigating the therapeutic effect of
1,5-Pentanediol (25% in a cream formulation) plus hydro-cortisone (1%) compared to only hydrocortisone (1%) onpatients with atopic dermatitis, there were 2 instances in eachtreatment group of a slight skin burning sensation after ap-plication. In the group treated with hydrocortisone and 1,5-
Pentanediol, a statistically signi ﬁcant decrease in S. aureus
colonies at weeks 2 and 6 of treatment was observed, whichwas not seen with treatment of hydrocortisone alone.
In a 6-month clinical trial evaluating the therapeutic effect
of 1,5-Pentanediol (25% in a gel formulation) on herpes la-bialis in patients with recurrent herpes episodes, there were notreatment-related adverse events reported; body weight andtemperature, heart rate, and clinical parameters were nearly
unchanged.
Information from case reports for the alkane diols included
allergic contact dermatitis as a result of dermal exposure to1,5-Pentanediol (.5 to 10%) in various creams; recommen-dations by study researchers for dental professionals exposedto Hexanediol in dentin primers to take precautions because ofthe potential to cause contact dermatitis following repeatedoccupational exposure; the adverse effects in adults (non-fatal
cases occurred with doses between 1 to 14 g, fatalities oc-
curred with 5.4 to 20 g doses) and poisoning in children (with14% 1,4-Butanediol by weight) from oral exposure to 1,4-Butanediol.
Discussion
The Panel reviewed the safety of 10 alkane diols and deter-
mined that the data were suf ﬁcient to determine safety for
seven of the ingredients, but insuf ﬁcient to determine safety of
the remaining three ingredients (i.e., 1,4-Butanediol, 2,3-Butanediol, and Octanediol). Maximum concentrations of usewere reported for several of the ingredients, and these con-centrations ranged from .006% (1,10-Decanediol) to 39.9%(Propanediol) in leave-on products. 1,4-Butanediol has usesreported in the VCRP, but concentrations of use were not
reported in response to the industry survey. Therefore, because
1,4-Butanediol can be metabolized into gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), which is a controlled sub-stance in the United States, and because of the wide range ofuse concentrations reported for the other ingredients, the Panelstated that concentration of use data are needed to determinesafety of 1,4-Butanediol.
Concentration of use data were not available for 2,3-Bu-
tanediol (not reported to be in use) and Octanediol, and ad-
ditional data were also lacking. The complete list of dataneeded to assess safety of these two ingredients includes:
·Concentration of use;
·28-day dermal toxicity studies;
·Dermal and reproductive toxicity data; and
·Mammalian genotoxicity studies, if the ingredients are
not used at low concentrations.Scott et al. 125S2,3-Butanediol can exist as 3 different stereoisomers. Data
on the toxicities of these isomers would help to inform thesafety assessment.
Variations in the regiochemistry of small alkane diols may
lead to signi ﬁcant differences in toxicity. For example, 2,5-
hexanediol, which is not a cosmetic ingredient, is known to be a
neurotoxic metabolite of hexane. However, the structurally
similar cosmetic ingredient, Hexanediol (i.e., 1,6-hexanediol), isnot a neurotoxin. The Panel discussed whether there was concernthat 2,5-hexanediol could be present as a signi ﬁcant impurity of
Hexanediol (aka 1,6-hexanediol). The Panel determined that,based on the low maximum concentration of Hexanediol re-ported (.5% in leave-on dermal contact cosmetics) and the >96%purity reported for Hexanediol, the potential presence of 2,5-
hexanediol would be toxicologically insigni ﬁcant.
During the initial review of this safety assessment, the
Panel requested neurotoxicity data for Isopentyldiol. No datawere received in response to this request. However, becauseoral toxicity studies with Isopentyldiol reported no adverseclinical or histopathological changes, and due to the fact thatbioactivation to a diketone similar to 2,5-hexanediol requires avery speci ﬁc pathway and was not likely to occur, the Panel no
longer felt these data were needed.
Although positive results were obtained in one mammalian
chromosomal aberration test at one concentration of Pro-panediol (2500 µg/mL without metabolic activation), anothermammalian chromosomal aberration test reported negativeresults at concentrations up to 5000 µg/mL Propanediol (withmetabolic activation). Additionally, the genotoxicity data forthe other alkane diols were largely negative, supporting the
fact that genotoxicity was not a likely concern for Propanediol.
Furthermore, the Panel noted that carcinogenicity data wereabsent, but because the genotoxicity data were largely neg-ative, carcinogenicity data were not needed.
Alkane diols, especially lower molecular weight alkane
diols such as 1,3-Propanediol, can enhance the penetration ofother ingredients through the skin. The Panel cautioned thatcare should be taken in formulating cosmetic products that
may contain these ingredients in combination with any in-
gredients whose safety was based on their lack of dermalabsorption data, or when dermal absorption was a concern.
Some of the alkane diols used as cosmetic ingredients, such
as Propanediol and 2,3-Butanediol, can be derived from plantsources. The Panel expressed concern about pesticide residuesand heavy metals that may be present in botanically sourcedingredients, and they stressed that the cosmetics industry
should continue to use current good manufacturing practices
(cGMPs) to limit any potential impurities.
The Panel discussed the issue of incidental inhalation ex-
posure from perfumes, hair sprays, deodorant sprays, and facepowders. The data that are available from animal inhalationstudies, including acute and short-term exposure data, suggestlittle potential for respiratory effects at relevant doses by theingredients that are used in products that could incidentally be
inhaled. Propanediol (up to 3%) and Isopentyldiol (up to 5%)are reportedly used in cosmetic products that may be aero-
solized and Isopentyldiol is used up to .33% in face powder thatmay become airborne. The Panel noted that most of thedroplets/particles produced in cosmetic aerosols and loose-powder cosmetic products would not be respirable to anyappreciable amount. The potential for inhalation toxicity is not
limited to respirable droplets/particles deposited in the lungs. In
principle, inhaled droplets/particles deposited in the nasopha-ryngeal and thoracic regions of the respiratory tract may causetoxic effects depending on their chemical and other properties.However, coupled with the small actual exposure in thebreathing zone and the concentrations at which the ingredientsare used, the available information indicates that incidentalinhalation would not be a signi ﬁcant route of exposure that
might lead to local respiratory or systemic effects. A detailed
discussion and summary of the Panel ’s approach to evaluating
incidental inhalation exposures to ingredients in cosmeticproducts is available at https://www.cir-safety.org/cir- ﬁndings .
Lastly, the Panel noted that for the most part, the alkane diols
were not irritants. However, Butyl Ethyl Propanediol (undilutedin one study, concentration not speci ﬁed in another) was irri-
tating to rabbit eyes. Butyl Ethyl Propanediol is not reported to
be used in formulations that are used in the eye area. However,
if it were to be included in products used near the eye, thoseproducts must be formulated to be non-irritating.
Conclusion
The Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety concludedthat the following 7 ingredients are safe in cosmetics in the
present practices of use and concentration described in this
safety assessment:
Propanediol Methylpropanediol
1,5-Pentanediol* Butyl Ethyl PropanediolHexanediol Isopentyldiol1,10-Decanediol
*Not reported to be in current use. Were the ingredient in
this group not in current use to be used in the future, theexpectation is that it would be used in product categories andat concentrations comparable to others in this group.
The Panel also concluded that the available data are in-
sufﬁcient to make a determination that 1,4-Butanediol, 2,3-
Butanediol, and Octanediol are safe under the intended
conditions of use in cosmetic formulations.
